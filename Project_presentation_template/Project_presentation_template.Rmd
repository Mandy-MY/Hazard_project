# Introduction
I joined CSIRO in 1989 as a laboartory technician. I have been fortunate to have had many oportunities in both technical and support roles in my 30 years. I moved into the HSE team in 2005 and in my current role as "HSE Specialist - Systems and Analytics" in 2018.
I manage our HSE reporting systems and forms, I have a really great working relationship with my IM&T colleagues. I am perfecty happy in the system administration space but I had very few current anaytical skills. I rely heavily on IM&T support for my 'data wrangling' and wanted to upskill.


# My Project
This **project**. was a 'proof of concept' to import, manipulate,interrogate and display data from HSE systems. 
The long-term view is to be able to bring data from multiple sources to look for potential markers or hotspots to enable effective resourcing and prevenatative programs.

With the incresing demand from the Board, ET and Busines Units for both regular and *ad hoc* HSE data anaylsis I am workig to create a process to accommodate these and be able to answer the 'what if', 'why'? questions. 
In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, and `kableExtra` packages.

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Yet another gapminder plot"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

...on taking the principles we'd learned and then tring to write the code to my specific situation.

I feel I grasped the concepts readily and applied them to the examples easily, but I am much better at taking what someone's done and modifying but less good a 'starting from scratch'

# Next steps

I'm really excited with the potential R offers and I'm keen to expand my skills and apply in a more holistic way. 
R offers much greater potential for sharing code for data analysis across HSE as it is a package available to anyone.

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!

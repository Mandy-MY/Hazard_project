# The categories_all data set is now very 'flat'. Ideally I'd like to have this so that the upper level hazard categories are a variable and the subcategories records within those. Challenge? Yes, I think so (ha!)
#gather and spread to the rescue (I hope); here goes...
#remember gather(dataset, where_to_store_column_names, where_to_store_values, what_to_gather, anything_to_ignore)
# I want to end up with columns Issue ID, BU, hazard category, hazard result (yes or no)

categories_long <- gather(categories_all, hazard_category,hazard_result,-Issue_ID,-Business_Unit)

#becuase in the first instance I am only interested in where a hazard has been identified (ie a 'yes') I'll create a dataset for hazards present

categories_present <- filter(categories_long, hazard_result == "Yes")

# hidden in the Hazard category is the category and subcategory details, gonna try splitting that out....
#get rid of the Hazard Category string at the start of each category
#get rid of added .x and .y text created at join - categories will be the same and have the same meaning 
#remove the space in the category Work Env as we need spaces to separate the columns in the next step


categories_present_tidy <- categories_present %>%                                    #create a new tidy data frame
  mutate(hazard_category = str_remove(hazard_category, "Hazard Categories ")) %>%    #this is telling R to overwrite the hazard_categories column (ie create a column with the same name = overwrite)and look for and remove the string (ie text) Hazard Categories 
  mutate(hazard_category = str_remove(hazard_category, "\\.x")) %>%                  #this is telling R to overwrite the hazard_categories column and look for and remove the literal text string .x (that was added at the join step)
  mutate(hazard_category = str_remove(hazard_category, "\\.y")) %>%                  #this is telling R to overwrite the hazard_categories column and look for and remove the literal text string .x (that was added at the join step)
  mutate(hazard_category = str_replace(hazard_category, "Work Env\\.?", "Work_Env")) #this is telling R to overwrite the hazard_categories column and look for anything that has Work Env with a literal full stop (the \\ denotes an actual full stop as opposed to any character) and the ? inicates any character either side of that, that will allow for both version or Work Env with and without the full stop to be replaced (from the  old hazard categories and new categories) 


# now with the cleaned hazard category and sub group in a string, time to split the columns into category and subgroup, and write this to a file as we will need it later.
Hazards_present_merged <- separate(categories_present_tidy, hazard_category, into = c("hazard_category", "hazard_subgroup"), sep = "\\s", extra = "merge")
write_csv(Hazards_present_merged, path = "data/processed_data/Hazards_present_merged.csv")

# and I probably should have done this earlier but as I intend to join the locations data to the merged hazard data so I'll write that to a csv file as well
write_csv(locations, path = "data/processed_data/locations.csv")

# and while I'm at it I may get around to the actions piece so let's create that file too
write_csv(actions, path = "data/processed_data/actions.csv")

# and so I have all the 'tidy' data I inteded I'm going to join merged hazards with locations and with actions
hazard_locations <- inner_join(Hazards_present_merged, locations, by = c("Issue_ID")) # need to add code to ingnore the repeated BU information
write_csv(hazard_locations, path = "data/processed_data/hazard_locations.csv")

hazard_actions <- inner_join(hazard_locations, actions, by = c("Issue_ID")) # incomplete code - but in the actins data the column name is Issue being addressed so need to fix this too

#Phew! That took longer than I thought but I'm getting it now :-)  time to start some example visualisations. I'm going to do some testing in anew scriot and then copy the ones I want tokeep into this file
